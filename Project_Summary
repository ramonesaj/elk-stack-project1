PROJECT 1 SUMMARY


Background

- This project serves as a continuation of a previous lesson on Cloud Security where Azure was used to
create a virtual network. Network security was provided by a network security group and a load balancer.
A jump box provisioner was used as a control point to tunnel to three webservers (VMs) located in the network.
The IT automation engine, Ansible, was used to run playbooks. These playbooks are created as YAML or .yml  
files which Ansible "runs" to install the DVWA container on each of the VMs.  

Objective

The goal for this project was to deploy an automated ELK stack.
- This project involved:
  - An understanding of network architecture (network diagrams)
  - Virtual network and virtual machine deployment using Azure
  - Introduction to Kibana using Filebeat and Metricbeat
  - Introduction to GitHub fundamentals
  - Scripting using YAML (.yml) files with Ansible
